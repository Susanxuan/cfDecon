# cfDecon

## Overview

cfDecon is an efficient deep-learning framework for cell-free DNA deconvolution analysis that operates at the resolution of individual reads. The tool uses a multichannel autoencoder core module and iterative refinement to estimate cell-type proportions and generate condition-aware cell-type-specific methylation profiles.

Example script can be found in ./scripts/run.sh
